* clean cruft from JspScript.Template
* minify boilerplate in generated fns, maybe pass it in as args?
* add more tests asserting java.lang.String -> JS string conversion for Rhino
* fix <jsp:include page="xxx"/> xxx handling -- relative/absolute issues
* what's up with fn returns?
  * strictly (jsp convention-wise), text returned by ${fn:xxx()} should be parsed to generate DOM nodes...
  * maybe:
    * if dom node is returned, then appendChild() it
    * if an array is returned, then appendChild() each item
    * if a string is returned, DOM parse it?  infinite recursion possible though, no?
  * probably better, but violating jsp expectations:
    * if dom node is returned, then appendChild() it
    * if an array is returned, then appendChild() each item
    * if a string is returned, add it as a text node
  * to avoid violating jsp expectations, we could use innerHTML trickery on strings?
